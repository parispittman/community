## Where:
Austin Convention Center  
500 E Cesar Chavez St,   
Austin, TX 78701  
(same location as KubeCon)

## Invitations:
Selected attendees are Kubernetes upstream contributors including SIG members and lottery winners from a [members of standing](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md) pool.
We realize that this is not the best approach now that our community is growing in exponential ways. In 2018, we will be unfolding a new strategy for bringing our contributors together so all voices can be heard. 

Invitees will begin going out on October 19th.

## Format:
"loosely-structured unconference"
Rather than speakers and presentations, we will have moderators/facilitators and discussion topics, alongside all-day completely unstructured hacking.

The discussion sessions will be in an open fishbowl format — rings of chairs, with inner rings driving the discussion — where anyone can contribute. The various sessions will be proposed and voted on by the community in the weeks leading up to the event. This allows the community to motivate the events of the day without dedicating precious day-of time to choosing the sessions and making a schedule.

There will be 3 rooms dedicated to these sessions running in parallel all day. Each session should last between 45 minutes and an hour.

Then, there will be 2 smaller rooms for hacking / unstructured discussion all day. 

## Call for Topics
Invites will include an area to list your proposed topic to lead for a potential session. Schedule will be announced at least one week before the event. 

## Desired Outcomes
* Generate notes from the sessions to feed the project's documentation and knowledge base, and also to keep non-attendees plugged in
* Make (and document) recommendations and decisions for the near-term and mid-term future of the project
* Come up with upcoming action items, as well as leaders for those action items, for the various topics that we discuss
